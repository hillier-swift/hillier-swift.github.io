I am a lead system administrator for a global company, and my blog is somewhere to put some of my useful musings. I have an interest in PowerShell, automation and streamlining processes. Also, I just starting to get a feel for fitness, so don't be surprised if I stray out of ICT posts.

All the content on this site are my own and doesn't reflect past, current or future employers.
