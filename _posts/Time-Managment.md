For awhile now I have been struggling with keeping on task, and while its still an ongoing process. I have spent more time tinking with my blog than I have writing this I have found some technicaes that have helped me. This is something I have built up over time, induduced slowly once I have felt confident in one area look at other areas to improve.

The areas I still need work on but have started working on are 

* Keeping on task
* Tracking Tasks
* Reaching deadlines

This isn't desinged as a how should you work more my journy and maybe you will find something useful for yours.
