For awhile now I have been struggling with keeping on task, and while its still an ongoing process. I have spent more time tinking with my blog than I have writing this I have found some technicaes that have helped me. This is something I have built up over time, induduced slowly once I have felt confident in one area look at other areas to improve.

The areas I still need work on but have started working on are.

* Keeping on task
* Reaching deadlines
* Tracking Tasks

This isn't desinged as a how should you work more my journy and maybe you will find something useful for yours.

## Keeping on task

When I first started looking at improving my productivity and output, I researched what the big CEO's were doing and scan read a load of blogs. Didn't have any real take aways other than everyone has there own best way. One thing that did stick in my mind was a technique called [Pomodoro](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), *have a read of that post the short verision is below.*

* Choose a task to be accomplished.
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper
* Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)
* Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break

I am not good at following insturctions so I have changed mine up to 30 minutes and don't put a check on a sheet of paper. When I started to test if this would work for me I just used the built in timer in Windows 10 which can be found in Alarms & Clocks.

I am still working on the breaks, I keep rolling into the next timeslot but I do try to stand up and move around, pat the puppy when I was feeling very keen did a few pushups (that didn't last)

But I felt this started to work and I was building a habbit of saying for the next slot I will just clear my mailbox, or work on my task list, but I wanted to take it one step further. My company works on timesheets and if I was tracking slices of time could I use my new love of time tracking to build my timesheets for me, I found out I could.

### Enter toggl

After a bit more research I found a tool that took it up a notch and made an account with [Toggle Track](https://track.toggl.com), this website/Windows App is a time management app. You can get reports, it syncs across devices and its base plan *(which I use is free)*. Out of the box it replaced my hand writting notes and some guess work. I setup up some "projects" which were areas I wanted to track when I start the timer all I do is start typing a project and it starts tracking it.

This was great my time sheets were more accurate, I was closer to my weekly hours. What I didn't know at the start was it had built in features for Pomodro. My two needs were covered in one place, how does Toggl do this? When you start your timer, once the alloted time has past you get a notifcation the slice is over what would you like to do carry on the project or start on a new one. It one button push and I have found doing this hasn't added any overhead to my day. You can make it tell you when to take a break and come back but thats current too much for me. 

> Toggl tip, Also it nags you when you forget to track your time, and its calanadar view means you can see missing chunks of time.

Out of everything I have done this app has changed the way I work and I have ideas on how I can intergate it more using call refernaces numbers to update calls via the Jira API. Meaning one app will do all my time management for me.

## Reaching deadlines

So I am good at tracking my time and getting smaller task done, my next issue was I was never doing the big stuff tasks that were an hour or more long. I always went will do that next time slice, problem was I never did. I needed a way to plan my time better get some of the bigger slices of my work pie done. I didn't want another app, I wanted something in my currenty workflow, something simple. I already had my meetings in outlook, why not book out meetings for my self
