For a while now, I have been struggling with keeping on task, and while it's still an ongoing process. I have spent more time tinkering with my blog than I have written this I have found some techniques that have helped me. This is something I have built up over time, introduced slowly once I have felt confident in one area look at other areas to improve.

The areas I still need to work on but have started working on are.

* Keeping on task
* Reaching deadlines
* Tracking Tasks

This isn't designed as a how should you work more my journey and maybe you will find something useful for yours.

## Keeping on task

When I first started looking at improving my productivity and output, I researched what the big CEO's were doing and scan read a load of blogs. Didn't have any real takeaways other than everyone has their way. One thing that did stick in my mind was a technique called [Pomodoro](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730), *have a read of that post the short version is below.*

* Choose a task to be accomplished.
* Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)
* Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings, then put a check on your sheet of paper
* Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)
* Every 4 Pomodoros take a more extended break

I am not good at following instructions, so I have changed mine up to 30 minutes and don't put a check on a sheet of paper. When I started to test if this would work for me, I just used the built-in timer in Windows 10 which can be found in Alarms & Clocks.

I am still working on the breaks, I keep rolling into the next timeslot but I do try to stand up and move around, pat the puppy when I was feeling very keen did a few pushups (that didn't last)

But I felt this started to work and I was building a habbit of saying for the next slot I will just clear my mailbox, or work on my task list, but I wanted to take it one step further. My company works on timesheets and if I was tracking slices of time could I use my new love of time tracking to build my timesheets for me, I found out I could.

### Enter toggl

After a bit more research, I found a tool that took it up a notch and made an account with [Toggle Track](https://track.toggl.com), this website/Windows App is a time management app. You can get reports, it syncs across devices and its base plan *(which I use is free)*. Out of the box it replaced my handwritten notes and some guesswork. I setup up some "projects" which were areas I wanted to track when I start the timer all I do is start typing a project, and it starts tracking it.

This was great my timesheets were more accurate, I was closer to my weekly hours. What I didn't know at the start, it had built-in features for Pomodoro. My two needs were covered in one place, how does Toggl do this? When you start your timer, once the allotted time has passed, you get a notification the slice is over. It asks what would you like to do; carry on the project or start on a new one. It a button push and I have found doing this hasn't added any overhead to my day. You can make it tell you when to take a break and come back but that's current too much for me. 

> Toggl tip, Also it nags you when you forget to track your time, and its calendar view means you can see missing chunks of time.

Out of everything I have done this app has changed the way I work and I have ideas on how I can integrate it more using call references numbers to update calls via the Jira API. Meaning one app will do all my time management for me.

## Reaching deadlines

So I am better at tracking my time and getting the smaller tasks done, my next issue was I was never getting to the big stuff tasks that were an hour or longer. I always said I will do that next time slice, the problem was I never did. I needed a way to plan my time better get some of the more significant pieces of my work pie done. I didn't want another app which is a bad habit of mine. I wanted something in my current workflow, something simple. I already had my meetings in outlook, why not book out appointments for my self. This one was a surprise to me it worked, I have found I have moved these chunks of time around, and if it's not a fun task it gets bounced a few times, but now some of the larger jobs are getting done. It's surprisedly simple and effective.

## Tracking Tasks

So I now have a good handle what I am spending my time on and taking some breaks to help maintain focus. I am getting to larger projecty tasks but when I get an email or a call and I say I will have a look at that, they can get lost. This is my current work in progress, I forget to check my notepad when using a kanban board like Trello it's like my notepad I forget to check it. So I need to start a good habit for work, and that is logging everything in my project management tool but don't think the office is interested in all the work in my house.

So this is a work in progress for me while I figure it out I am currently using Toggl plan. Which like Trello is more a project management tool and is more useful for a task that requires planning works. But like when using Trello I keep forgetting about it. Other examples are Microsofts Planner which I have started using for work and if I get external sharing working with my personal O365 account could mean I can see all tasks in one place. Till then just sticking to planning tasks with Toggl Plan, an example below of my home network upgrade plan.

## Personal goals

Always up for knowing what the next thing to work on is and once I got some task tracking habits built and used to actioning them, whats next? When doing research on building habits, rewards and visualisations of completion have a positive effect on your wellbeing. I am currently in the research stage, but the idea is for recurring tasks is having a way to visualise that I have done it. If I work out five times in a week seeing a green mark reinforces a job well done. I want to read at least for one hour a week a non-fiction book, or write a blog post a month. Seeing a streak going and not wanting to break that is a powerful tool for motivation.

So far I have for my testing.

* [stickK](https://www.stickk.com/) - Can put money on the line for a habit, sign a "commitment Contract" but also can have friends be referee and a supporter to ensure you stick to your goal
* [Habitify](https://habitify.me) - little less daunting that StickK but can only have 3 habits being tracked before you have to fork out some money

## Doesn't all this make you less productive

At first, I noticed a slight drop in productivity as I played with the new tools and tweaked them but now with Toggl is fire and forget, every 30 minutes is goes you still doing this work or time to move on, and I push a button. Having all that data saves my timesheet guesswork. Adding items into outlook does take time, but if I didn't, I might not get to it. The most significant time sink is tracking tasks but knowing when I should chase someone or when I promised to look at a thing and never deliver is another angle to productivity. And who doesn't like seeing items crossed off when something has been done

What about you, any productivity or time management tips?
