title: Manually Adding or Removing a shared mailbox from Outlook 2016
---

With Outlook 2016 most shared mailboxes will automatically be added to your outlook client. If the mailbox has been around for awhile it needs a little bit of help. This is the guide I send to users to add or remove a shared mailbox.

* Select File in the upper left corner of the screen.
* Select Account Settings > Account Settings.
* Select your primary account and then double click on it
* Click More settings
* Select Advanced tab
  * To add a mailbox, Select Add and type the email address of the mailbox as it appears in the address list
  * Remove the mailbox select the mailbox you are wanting to remove
* Select OK
* Select Next
* Select Done
* Select Close
* Restart Outlook and see if the mailbox is Added/removed

> Tip - If you don't find your mailbox in the account settings contact your IT department as this a new style mailbox and you will need your permissions removed for it to be removed from Outlook.
